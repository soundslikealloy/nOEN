### :gear: Anaconda Python installation
This code is built up in Python. To execute this Python scripts is recommended the installation of **Anaconda**. **Anaconda Python** is a free, open-source platform that allows to write and execute code in the programming language Python ([Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)). This platform simplifies package installation, managment and development, and alos comes with a large number of libraries/packages that can be you for your projects. To install **Anaconda**, just head to the [Anaconda Documentation website](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) and follow the instructions to download teh installer for your operating system.

### Anaconda Navigator
Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface that allows you to launch applications and efficiently manage conda packages, environments, and channels without using command-line commands. For more info, click [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/).

### Anaconda Prompt or Terminal
Anaconda Prompt is a command line interface with Anaconda Distribution. Terminal is a command line interface that comes with macOS and Linux. To open it in **Windows**: Click Start, search for _"Anaconda Prompt"_ and click to open. In **macOS**: use Cmd+Space to open Spotlight Search and type _"Navigator"_ to open the program. In **Linux-CentOS**: open Applications > System Tools > Terminal.

### Spyder
Spyder is a Python development environment with many features for working with Python code, such as a text editor, debugger, profiler, and interactive console. You can execute **Spyder** using the **Anaconda Navigator**. You can find Spyder Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2Dap5SfXkI&list=PLPonohdiDqg9epClEcXoAPUiK0pN5eRoc&ab_channel=SpyderIDE).

### Python packages
A **Python package** is a collection of files containing Python code (i.e., modules). To execute **nOEN**, the following packages must to be installed:
- **Numpy.** NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. For more info and tutorials, click [here](https://numpy.org/).
- **Pandas**. Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. For more info and tutorials, click [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
- **SciPy**. SciPy is an open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. This package provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other. For more info and tutorials, click [here](https://scipy.org/).

### Installation of packages using Anaconda Navigator
You can install any Python package using the **Anaconda Navigator**. For this, execute the navigator and click to **Environments**. In this section you can install new packages and delete the already installed. For more info, click [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/).

### Installation of packages using pip
**pip** is the package installer for Python. In general, pip installs the minimal instalation requirements automatically, but not the optionals requirements. To install the mentioned packages using pip, you have only to write the following command lines in **Anaconda Prompt or Terminal**:

**NumPy**:
```
pip install numpy
```
**Pandas**:
```
pip install pandas
```
**SciPy**:
```
pip install scipy
```
## :clipboard: Instructions to Download and Run nOEN
1. Download .zip code. Last version: `v0.1`. [Download package](https://github.com/soundslikealloy/nOEN-py).
2. Extract files to a destination (:bulb: recommendation - Desktop).
3. Open **Anaconda Prompt or Terminal**.
